# Stress Relaxation Test
Data was collected through a lab for the course: BME 281L Mechanics of Deformable Solids Lab.
I usually use excel to process lab data, but wanted to try using Python to practice using the matplotlib, panda, and numPy libraries.
I've added detailed comments throughtout to take you through my thought process, hopefully inspiring you to try switching from excel too!

The purpose of this lab was to examine visoelastic materials and how they differ from elastic materials under constant strain.
Still a work in progress.
